hints:
    - content: "The flag is made up of 5 parts; each part can be found somewhere on the website with a number corresponding to its order. e.g.: 1: MINUTEMAN{, 2: abc, 3: def, 4 ghi} would combine to form MINUTEMAN{abcdefghi}."
    - content: "The quotes button says to look in HTML, JS, and CSS. I heard that you can open a thing called 'devtools' to see them."
    - content: "Look in robots.txt for two of the flag parts."
