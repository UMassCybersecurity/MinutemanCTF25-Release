description: "Pearl has been noticing strange sounds coming from around Beach City. \
              She suspects that Peridot or the Diamonds might be up to this. Can you help \
              her find out the meaning of this strange noise?\n \
              This file contains a repeated message. The flag will be one instance of the \
              message written in all capital letters with spaces replaced by underscores. \
              For example, if the message was 'OH NO ITS THE ICE KING OH NO ITS THE ICE KING OH NO....' \
              the flag would be MINUTEMAN{OH_NO_ITS_THE_ICE_KING}"
